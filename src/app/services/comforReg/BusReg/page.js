          <h3>Private Limited Company (PLC)</h3>
          <p>
            A Private Limited Company is one of the most popular business
            structures in India, offering limited liability protection to its
            shareholders. The registration of a company as a PLC involves
            several steps:
          </p>
          <div className={styles.unordered1}>
            <ul>

            operations.

            and shareholder. Key steps include:
          </p>
          <div className={styles.unordered1}>
