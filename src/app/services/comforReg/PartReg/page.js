            <h2>Introduction to Partnership Firms</h2>
            <h3>What is a Partnership Firm?</h3>
            <p>
              A partnership firm is a type of business entity where two or more
              individuals come together to run a business and share its profits
              and losses. Partnership firm registration is the process of
              formally establishing this business structure under the legal
              framework of a country.

            <h2>Proprietorship vs. Partnership Firm</h2>
            <h3>Differences Between Proprietorship and Partnership Firms</h3>
            <p>
              When considering firm registration, it's important to understand
              the differences between proprietorship and partnership structures:
            </p>
            <div className={styles.unordered1}>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Ownership: Proprietorship has a single owner, while
                  partnerships have multiple owners.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Decision-making: In a proprietorship, the owner has sole
                  decision-making power. In partnerships, decisions are made
                  jointly.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Capital: Partnerships often have access to more capital due to
                  multiple partners' contributions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Liability: Proprietors have unlimited personal liability,
                  while some partnership structures (like LLP) offer limited
                  liability.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Continuity: Proprietorships typically end with the owner's
                  death or incapacity, while partnerships can continue with
                  succession planning.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
              When choosing between firm registration proprietorship and
              partnership, consider factors such as:

            <div className={styles.unordered1}>
              <ul>
                <li>The scale of your business</li>
