              Company Types: Choosing the Right Structure for Your Business
            </h2>
            <p>
              {" "}
              When embarking on your entrepreneurial journey in India, one of
              the first crucial decisions is selecting the appropriate company
              structure. Let's explore two popular options:
            </p>

            <h3>Private Limited Company (PLC)</h3>
            <p>
              A private limited company, also known as a private limited
              corporation or private ltd company, is one of the most preferred
              business structures in India, especially for startups and small to
              medium-sized enterprises.
            </p>
            <h2>Key features of a private limited firm:</h2>
            <div className={styles.unordered1}>
              <ul>
                <li>Limited liability protection for shareholders</li>
                <li>Separate legal entity status</li>
                <li>Easier access to funding and <a href="https://www.cadhirajostwal.com/services/advisory_services/Loan&Funding">loans</a></li>
                <li>Enhanced credibility with clients and partners</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The process of transitioning from a private limited to limited
                company structure is also possible as your business grows,
                offering additional benefits and opportunities for expansion.
              </p>
            </div>
            <h3>One Person Company (OPC)</h3>
            <p>
              For solopreneurs or individuals looking to start a business on
              their own, the one-person company structure offers an excellent
              option. Introduced in the Companies Act 2013, an OPC combines the
              benefits of a private limited company with simplified compliance
              requirements.
            </p>
            <h3>Advantages of a one-person company:</h3>
            <div className={styles.unordered1}>
              <ul>
                <li>Limited liability protection for shareholders</li>
                <li>Easier compliance and reporting obligation </li>
                <li>
                  Option to convert to a private limited company as the business

            <p>
              When considering ISO certification for your company, it's
              essential to choose the right standard based on your industry and
              business requirements. Some popular ISO standards include:
            </p>
            <div className={styles.unordered1}>
              <ul>
                <li>ISO 9001: Quality Management System </li>

                <li>Access to global markets</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
              To obtain ISO certification, companies typically engage with an
              ISO certification organization or ISO certification companie s
              that specialize in auditing and certifying businesses against
              specific ISO standards.
