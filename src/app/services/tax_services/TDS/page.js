            <h2>Understanding TDS (Tax Deducted at Source)</h2>
            <h3>What is TDS and why is it important?</h3>
            <p>
              TDS meaning: Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) is a method of
              collecting{" "}
              <a href="https://www.cadhirajostwal.com/services/tax_services/IncomeTax">
                income tax
              </a>{" "}
              at the point where income is generated. It's a system where the
              payer deducts a certain percentage of tax before making a payment
              to the recipient. This ensures a steady flow of tax revenue for
              the government and helps prevent tax evasion.
            </p>

            <h2>FAQ</h2>
            <h3>What is TDS?</h3>
            <span>
              TDS is a tax deducted by the payer (the person making a payment)
              and directly remitted to the government on behalf of the payee
              (the person receiving the payment). This is done to ensure that
              tax is collected at the source of income.
            </span>
            <br />
            <h3>What are the TDS rates?</h3>
            <span>
              The TDS rates vary depending on the nature of the payment and the
              payee's status. For example, TDS rates for interest income from
              banks may differ from those for professional fees.
            </span>
            <br />
            <h3>How is TDS deducted?</h3>
            <span>
              TDS is typically deducted from the payment made to the payee. The
              deducted amount is then remitted to the government using the
              electronic TDS return (TDS return 26QB).
            </span>
            <br />
            <h3>How can I avoid TDS penalties?</h3>
            <span>
              To avoid TDS penalties, ensure that you comply with all TDS
              requirements, including timely deduction, remittance, and filing
              of returns. You may also need to obtain PAN (Permanent Account
              Number) from the payee to claim TDS credit.
            </span>
            <br />
            <h3>What is Form 16?</h3>
            <span>
              Form 16 is a TDS certificate issued by the payer to the payee. It
              provides details of the TDS deducted and remitted on the payee's
              behalf.
