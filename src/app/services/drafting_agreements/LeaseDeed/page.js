            <h1>Introduction: W hat is a Lease Deed?</h1>
            <p>
              A lease deed is a legally binding document that outlines the terms
              and conditions under which a property owner (landlord) agrees to
              rent out their property to another party (tenant). This crucial
              document serves as the foundation of the landlord-tenant
              relationship, providing clarity and protection for both parties
              involved.
            </p>
            <p>
              While often used interchangeably, a lease deed differs from a
              rental agreement in terms of duration and formality. A lease deed
              typically covers longer periods and is more comprehensive in its
              terms, while a rental agreement is often used for shorter-term
              arrangements
              <sup>1</sup>.
            </p>

            <h2>Key Components of a Lease Agreement</h2>
            <p>
              A well-drafted lease agreement contract should include several
              essential clauses:
            </p>
            <div className={styles.unordered1}>
              <ul>
                <li>Names and addresses of all parties involved</li>
                <li>Property description</li>
                <li>Lease term and renewal options</li>
                <li>Rent amount and payment terms</li>
                <li>Security deposit details</li>
                <li>Maintenance responsibilities</li>
                <li>Rules and restrictions</li>
                <li>Termination conditions</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
              When using a lease agreement template, it's crucial to customize
              it to your specific situation and local laws<sup>2</sup>.
